    "## Steps to Set Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Create a GitHub Repository**\n",
    "   - Ensure your code is hosted in a GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Define a Workflow**\n",
    "   - In your repository, create a directory named `.github/workflows`.\n",
    "   - Add a YAML file (e.g., `ci-cd.yml`) inside this directory. This file defines the workflow.\n",

    "### 4. **Key Points in the Workflow**\n",
    "- **`on:`**: Specifies the events that trigger the workflow (e.g., `push` to the main branch or `pull_request`).\n",
    "- **`jobs:`**: Defines a set of tasks (e.g., `build` and `deploy`).\n",
    "- **`steps:`**: Each job contains a series of steps to execute.\n",
    "- **`uses:`**: Reusable GitHub Actions such as `actions/checkout` or `actions/setup-python`.\n",
    "- **`run:`**: Executes custom shell commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Set Up Secrets**\n",
    "For secure deployments:\n",
    "1. Go to your repository’s **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**.\n",
    "2. Add secrets like `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, `SERVER_IP`, or any other sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Create a Deployment Script**\n",
    "If deploying to a server, write a script (e.g., `deploy_script.sh`) that:\n",
    "- Pulls the latest code.\n",
    "- Restarts the application.\n",
    "- Runs necessary setup commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Test Your Workflow**\n",
    "1. Push changes to the `main` branch.\n",
    "2. View the workflow progress under the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Tips\n",
    "- For containerized apps, integrate Docker and push images to a registry like Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry.\n",
    "- Use services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for hosting. Integrate deployment actions specific to those platforms.\n",
